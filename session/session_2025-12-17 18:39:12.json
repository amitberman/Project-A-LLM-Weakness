    "assitant_response#0": "Certainly! It looks like there's a small mistake in your array: `arr = [1, 8, 4, 25, 4]`. Arrays should not have duplicate elements unless you intend to. I'll proceed with the given array and provide an algorithm that sorts it.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple Python implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    # Traverse through all array elements\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Last i elements are already sorted, no need to check them again\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 8, 4, 25, 4]\nbubble_sort(arr)\n\nprint(\"Sorted array is:\", arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Outer Loop (`for i in range(n)`):** This loop runs `n` times where `n` is the length of the array. Each iteration ensures that one more element is sorted.\n  \n- **Inner Loop (`for j in range(0, n-i-1)`):** This loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are out of order.\n\n### Output:\n\nWhen you run this code with your given array `[1, 8, 4, 25, 4]`, the output will be:\n```\nSorted array is: [1, 4, 4, 8, 25]\n```\n\nThis algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.
