Here's one way to sort the array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm:\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    for i in range(n-1):\n        swapped = False\n        \n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n                \n    return arr\n\narr = [1, 8, 4, 25, 4]\nsorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)\n```\nThis algorithm works by repeatedly iterating over the array and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until no more swaps are needed, at which point the array is sorted.",
